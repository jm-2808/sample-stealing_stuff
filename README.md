# Stealing Stuff Sample Files
Sample files from the Stealing Stuff project\
An arcade-style game developed in C++ and Unreal Blueprint, where players steal objects in the environment by moving them to a specified zone, while avoiding detection\
A trailer for the game can be found at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ39e2bVUx4]\
This repository contains c++ files for some of the features I worked on:
- Characters folder	-> Contains files for the characters and the modular character model system
- Camera folder	    -> Contains files for the in-game camera
- Objects folder	-> Contains files for the stealable object base class and zone types
- Systems folder	-> Contains files for the game manager and various data assets used in the game
